# **My NumPy Learning Journey**
Hi there! This repository documents my journey of learning NumPy, the powerful Python library for numerical computing.

In this repository, you will find the following:
- Notes: My understanding of key concepts, written in a way that I can understand and revisit later.
- Code examples: Experiments and explorations of different NumPy functionalities.
  
This is a work in progress, so feel free to explore and see what I've learned so far.
